#  Forest Fire Prediction Web Application

##  Project Overview
This project predicts the possibility of forest fires based on environmental parameters using a Machine Learning model.  
The trained ML model is integrated into a Flask-based web application that allows users to input values and get real-time predictions.

This project demonstrates the **complete ML lifecycle**:
data preprocessing → model training → model saving → model loading → web deployment.
